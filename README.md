This repo doesn't have any code, it's just a convenient dumping ground for any issues users might find

# Instructions (for testers)

### 1. Log in / Sign up for a Github account
You'll need a Github account to report issues and bugs.

### 2. Learn how to report a bug! *This is very important!*

In order to fix a bug, we have to be able to reproduce the error or problem you've encountered.

# Therefore, please follow the example format below.

##### BASIC INFORMATION:
```
Operating System: MacOS
Browser         : Chrome
Version         : 2.4.3*
Optional Info   : I was using 2017 Macbook Pro

Version # is at the bottom of settings screens in the Apps, ignore for web
Optional info is just anything else you think might be important
```

* This information lets us know which build/version of the app has a problem *

##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
```
1. Start playing a lesson
2. Swith to a different tab
3. Let the lesson play in the background tab for a 10 mins
4. Come back to the lesson tab
```

* If we can't reproduce the bug, we can't fix it!*

##### WHAT I EXPECTED TO HAPPEN:
```
I expected that my learning minutes will increase by 10 mins
```

* Knowing what you were actually expecting to happen is much more helpful than only knowing what the error was. *

##### WHAT HAPPENED INSTEAD:
```
My learning minutes didn't increase at all
```

* This lets us know what the allegedly bad result was. *
